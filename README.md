# Janna
Janna is a Twitch TTS bot, designed as a Java-alternative to [Anna](https://www.project610.com/anna/), a now-almost-entirely-abandoned Windows based IRC TTS bot.

If you want something basic, that mostly works on Windows, maybe try Anna.

### Why use Janna?
Janna has cool features, like different voices for different users (Accent/Pitch/Speed), sound effects, and... Probably other stuff. If you want to make things a little more noisy and personal, or just keep up with Twitch chat without having to look away from what you're doing, then maybe you wanna try Janna.

### What's required to use Janna?
* The easy requirement is Java. Gotta have at least Java 8 installed.
* The less-easy requirement is Google Cloud. I'm gonna level with you, it's a bit of a pain to set up. 
* * [Signing up with Google Cloud to use Janna](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t01Yv0U0TXHnbCyJB92wqj_TOxs0_RK9sVQK8V8sguQ)

**I need to make it clear that Google technically lets you use their TTS api for 'free', but only if you're signed up and have a payment method in case you go over the free quota**

I've never gone over the limit (4M chars/month), but if you've got a big channel with a super-active chat, then Google charges $4/1M chars. It's not a lot, but it could add up if you don't have a ton of money. 

Anyway, if you're cool with all that, once you've got your Google Cloud stuff set up, you should be able to run Janna by downloading and running the JAR file.
